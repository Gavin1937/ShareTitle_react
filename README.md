# react frontend for ShareTitle

A react frontend build for my other project [ShareTitle](https://github.com/Gavin1937/ShareTitle)

* all icons are coming from [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

# build & deploy

```sh
npm run build

npm install -g serve

serve -s build
```

### also consider deploy whole ShareTitle project with docker-compose
