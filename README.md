# react frontend for ShareTitle

A react frontend build for my other project [ShareTitle](https://github.com/Gavin1937/ShareTitle)

* all icons are coming from [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

# build & deploy

```sh
npm run build

npm install -g serve

serve -s build
```

### disable authentication

If you disabled authentication in backend application, this frontend will still asking for a username & password

You can enter dummy username and password to bypass the login page.

### also consider deploy whole ShareTitle project with docker-compose
